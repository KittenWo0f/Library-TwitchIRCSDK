# TwitchIRCSDK
TwitchIRC Software Development Kit - Simplifies integration to Twitch API.

# Installation

To keep things cross-platform, we want to use cmake; see https://github.com/bsmithcompsci/TwitchIRC-Sample to see a full example project.
```cmake
add_subdirectory(ThirdParty/TwitchIRCSDK)

target_link_libraries(MyProject PRIVATE TwitchIRCSDK)
```
